######## MODELING VARIABLES RELATED TO LAB WORK AND TESTING THE IMPACT OF FACTORS SUCH AS TISSUE TYPE, MULTIPLEXING, SEQUENCING PLATFORM#######
################################################# ON TARGET CAPTURE SUCCESS ###################################################################

# A regression model can be built using brms (see references below) to test for the impact of multiple steps in the lab on the success of 
# hybrid / target capture for many samples, which can be used a guide to optimise lab steps.

# brms: An R Package for Bayesian Multilevel Models Using Stan (see Bürkner PC (2017) 1–28.doi:10.18637/jss.v080.i01 https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v080i01/0). 
# See some examples here: https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/

# To model response variables (example here: percentage of the off-target plastome recovered during Hybrid Capture reactions) and whether a 
# predictor variable impacts (increases or decreases) that response variable (such as type of leaf material: herbarium, fresh, 
# silica-dried).
# As our samples were processed using different hybrid capture probe kit versions (v. 1-3) that may also affect the percentage of the plastome 
# recovered, we account for the dependency in the data by including probe kit version as the "group-level" variable.
